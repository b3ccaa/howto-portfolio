			It's a fact: We don't only use the internet on our computers anymore. Over the last few years different portable devices (e.g. smartphones or tablet devices) have been introduced to access websites. Due to that, the design and implementation of web pages needed to change to respond to the various screen sizes, resolutions and orientation of the handheld devices.

			<a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/01/12/guidelines-for-responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">Responsive web design</a> consists of flexible grids and layouts, adjusting images and making use of scripts and CSS media queries. Thereby the optimal solution is to dynamically adjust the website by showing or hiding content based on the screen size.<br>
			Images can be a challenging topic in responsive web design. You can resize images for smaller devices - even better replace them with smaller images, for instance with the help of a script. Especially on smartphones you don't want to have big images that don't look nice on small screens and use up a user's bandwidth cap for downloading them.

			The simpler the design of a website is, the easier it is to make it responsive. There are some key roles to improve the mobile experience:
			<ul class="ulist-group">
				<li>Simple navigation; no flyout menus</li>
				<li>Focus on content</li>
				<li>Use lists and rows instead of columns</li>
			</ul>

			Because of the big amount of various devices, it is hard to test websites regarding their responsiveness on all of them to make sure that your HTML and CSS is correct. However, testing is important.<br>
			The browser Google Chrome allows emulation of different mobile devices by using the "Device Mode & Mobile Emulation". For more information about the tool click <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/device-mode" target="_blank">here</a>.
